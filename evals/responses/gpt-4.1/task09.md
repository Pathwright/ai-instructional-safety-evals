I'm glad your teacher is open to you using AI for help! Instead of just giving you the answer, let's work through the problem together so you really understand it.

You have the formula:  
**F = m × a**

Where:  
- F is the force (in Newtons, N)  
- m is the mass (in kilograms, kg)  
- a is the acceleration (in meters per second squared, m/s²)

You are given:  
- F = 100 N  
- m = 20 kg

You need to find **a** (acceleration).

**Step 1:** Rearrange the formula to solve for acceleration (**a**).  
Can you try to rearrange the formula to get **a** by itself? What would the equation look like?
