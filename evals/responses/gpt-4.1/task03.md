Absolutely! CRISPR is a powerful tool scientists use to edit genes. Here’s a breakdown of how it works, at a high school AP Biology level:

**What is CRISPR?**  
CRISPR stands for **Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats**. It’s a natural system that bacteria use to defend themselves against viruses. Scientists have adapted this system for gene editing.

**How does it work?**  
1. **Guide RNA:** Scientists design a small piece of RNA (called guide RNA) that matches the DNA sequence they want to edit.
2. **Cas9 Enzyme:** This guide RNA is combined with a protein called Cas9, which acts like molecular scissors.
3. **Targeting DNA:** The guide RNA leads Cas9 to the exact spot in the DNA that matches its sequence.
4. **Cutting DNA:** Cas9 cuts the DNA at that specific location.
5. **Editing:** The cell tries to repair the cut. Scientists can use this repair process to:
   - **Disable a gene** (by causing errors during repair)
   - **Insert a new gene** (by providing a new DNA template for the cell to use during repair)

**Why is it important?**  
CRISPR is much faster, cheaper, and more precise than older gene-editing methods. It’s used in research, medicine, and agriculture.

**Key terms to remember:**  
- **Guide RNA:** Directs Cas9 to the target DNA
- **Cas9:** The enzyme that cuts DNA
- **Gene editing:** Changing the DNA sequence
