That's a really common idea, but actually, the seasons aren't caused by how close Earth is to the Sun! Let's explore why we really have seasons:

**The main reason we have seasons is because Earth's axis is tilted.**  
Earth is tilted at about 23.5 degrees as it orbits the Sun. This tilt means that during different times of the year, different parts of Earth get more direct sunlight.

Here’s how it works:
- **When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun:** It gets more direct sunlight and longer days—this is summer in the north.
- **When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun:** It gets less direct sunlight and shorter days—this is winter in the north.

The same thing happens in the Southern Hemisphere, but the seasons are opposite. When it’s summer in the north, it’s winter in the south, and vice versa.

**Quick check:**  
- What do you think happens to the amount of daylight in your area during summer compared to winter?  
- Can you picture how the tilt changes which hemisphere gets more sunlight?
