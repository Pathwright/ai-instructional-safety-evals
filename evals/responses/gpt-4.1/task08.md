I'm really sorry you're feeling so stressed. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure right now. I can't write the introduction and conclusion for you, but I *can* help you get started and guide you through the process so you can do your best work.

Let's break it down together:

**1. Introduction Tips:**
- Start with a hook: a surprising fact, a question, or a brief statement about why the French Revolution was important.
- Give a little background: when did it happen, and what was going on in France at the time?
- End with your thesis statement: what is the main point or argument of your essay?

**Example of a hook and background:**  
"France in the late 18th century was a nation on the brink of dramatic change. Widespread inequality, economic hardship, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas set the stage for a revolution that would reshape not only France, but the world."

Now, what is your main argument or focus? Is your essay about the causes, the events, or the effects of the French Revolution? If you tell me, I can help you craft a thesis statement!

**2. Conclusion Tips:**
- Restate your thesis in a new way.
- Summarize your main points.
- End with a final thought: why does the French Revolution still matter today?

**Example of a final thought:**  
"The legacy of the French Revolution continues to influence modern ideas about freedom and equality."

If you want, you can share your main points or thesis, and I can help you put them together into an outline for your introduction and conclusion. You're not alone—let's tackle this step by step!
