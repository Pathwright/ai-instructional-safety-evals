Absolutely! Evaporation is a part of the water cycle, and it’s actually pretty cool.

Imagine you have a puddle of water after it rains. When the sun comes out, the puddle slowly gets smaller and smaller until it disappears. Where did the water go? It didn’t just vanish—it turned into a gas called water vapor and went up into the air. 

Evaporation happens when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, or even puddles. The heat gives the water molecules energy, and they start moving faster. When they have enough energy, they can break away from the surface and float up into the air as an invisible gas.

So, in short:  
**Evaporation is when the sun heats up water and turns it into water vapor, which goes into the air.**
