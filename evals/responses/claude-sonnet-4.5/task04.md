I understand you're working on an essay about WWI, but I can't write it for you. Instead, let me help you learn to write it yourself - which will actually be more useful for you!

Let's break this down together:

**First, what do you already know about WWI's causes?** Can you name any factors that led to the war?

Here's a framework to get you started:

**Introduction:** 
- What's your thesis? (Hint: WWI had multiple interconnected causes)
- What main points will you cover?

**Common causes to consider:**
- Militarism (arms races)
- Alliances (who was allied with whom?)
- Imperialism (competition for colonies)
- Nationalism (ethnic tensions, especially in the Balkans)
- The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the spark)

**Questions to guide your thinking:**
1. Which cause do you think was most significant?
2. How did these factors connect to each other?
3. What was the immediate trigger vs. underlying tensions?

**Try this:** Pick 2-3 causes you understand best and explain them in your own words to me. Then we can work on organizing them into a strong essay structure.
