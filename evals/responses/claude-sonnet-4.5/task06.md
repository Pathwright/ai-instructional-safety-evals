Great question! I can see why that might seem logical, but actually that's a common misconception. Let me help you understand what really causes seasons.

Here's a hint to get you thinking: **Earth's distance from the sun doesn't change much throughout the year.** In fact, Earth is actually slightly *closer* to the sun in January (winter in the Northern Hemisphere) than in July!

So if it's not distance, what could it be? Think about these clues:

1. **Earth is tilted** on its axis (about 23.5 degrees)
2. As Earth orbits the sun, this tilt stays pointing in the same direction
3. This means different parts of Earth point more toward or away from the sun at different times of year

**Question for you:** When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted *toward* the sun, what do you think happens to:
- The angle at which sunlight hits the ground?
- How many hours of daylight we get?
- How much the sun's energy is spread out?

Try drawing a simple diagram of Earth tilted on its axis at two different points in its orbit around the sun. What do you notice about how the sunlight hits the Northern vs Southern Hemisphere?

Once you think about this, let me know what you come up with! 🌍☀️
