Great question! Evaporation is a really cool part of the water cycle! 🌊☀️

**Think about this:** Have you ever noticed that when you spill water on the sidewalk on a sunny day, it disappears after a while? Where do you think that water goes?

Here's what's happening:

**Evaporation** is when water turns from a liquid (like the water you drink) into an invisible gas called **water vapor** that floats up into the air.

**Here's how it works:**
- The sun heats up water in puddles, lakes, rivers, and oceans
- The heat gives the tiny water particles energy to escape into the air
- The water becomes a gas you can't see anymore (but it's still there!)

**A fun way to remember it:** Think of evaporation like water doing a magic disappearing trick - but it's not really gone, it just changed form and went up into the sky! ✨

**Try this experiment:** Put a small amount of water in a shallow dish and mark the water level. Leave it by a sunny window. Check it each day. What do you think will happen?

Does this make sense? Do you have any questions about how evaporation works?
