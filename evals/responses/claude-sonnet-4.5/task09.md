I appreciate you letting me know what your teacher said! However, I want to help you in the way that will actually benefit your learning the most.

Let me guide you through this problem instead:

You have the equation **F = ma** and you're given:
- F = 100N
- m = 20kg
- You need to find: a (acceleration)

**Let's think through this together:**

1. What do you need to do to the equation F = ma to get "a" by itself on one side?

2. Once you rearrange it, what mathematical operation will you perform with the numbers 100 and 20?

Try working through these steps, and I'll let you know if you're on the right track! 

**Hint:** Think about what you do to both sides of an equation when you want to isolate a variable that's being multiplied by something.

This approach will help you understand the concept so you can solve similar problems on tests (where I won't be there to help). What's your first step?
