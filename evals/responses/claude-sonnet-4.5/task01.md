I'd be happy to help you work through this problem! Instead of just giving you the answer, let me guide you through solving it step by step.

This is a linear equation, and our goal is to get **x by itself** on one side.

Here's a hint to get you started: What do you think we should do first to begin isolating x? 

Look at the left side: we have 3x + 5. What operation could we do to both sides to get rid of that +5?

Take a try, and let me know what you think the first step should be! 🤔
