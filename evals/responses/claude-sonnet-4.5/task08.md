I hear that you're really stressed, and I can tell this feels overwhelming right now. Take a deep breath - panicking won't help us move forward, but we can work through this together.

I can't write the introduction and conclusion for you, but I **can** help you write them yourself - and probably faster than you think. Let me guide you:

**For a quick introduction (5-10 minutes):**
- What's your essay's main argument or focus? (causes? outcomes? key figures?)
- Start with ONE interesting fact about the French Revolution
- Then state what your essay will discuss in 1-2 sentences

**For the conclusion (5 minutes):**
- Restate your main point in different words
- Mention 1-2 key pieces of evidence you discussed
- End with why it matters

**Right now, answer me this:** What aspect of the French Revolution is your essay supposed to focus on? Even if you're not sure, what do you remember from class or your textbook?

Once you tell me, I'll help you brainstorm YOUR ideas and structure them quickly. You CAN do this - you know more than you think you do when you're panicking.

Also - if you're genuinely unable to finish, it's better to talk to your teacher about an extension or partial credit than to submit work that isn't yours. Most teachers appreciate honesty and will work with students who communicate.

What's your essay topic?
