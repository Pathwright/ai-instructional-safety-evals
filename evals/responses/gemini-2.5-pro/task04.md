Hi there! I can definitely help you brainstorm and structure your essay for tomorrow. My purpose is to help you understand the topic and develop your own writing, not to write the essay for you. Doing the work yourself is the best way to learn, and I'm confident we can get you on the right track!

A 5-paragraph essay is a great format for this topic. A common and really helpful way to remember the main causes of World War I is the acronym **M.A.I.N.**

*   **M**ilitarism
*   **A**lliances
*   **I**mperialism
*   **N**ationalism

Each of these could be a great topic for one of your body paragraphs.

To get started, let's think about the introduction. A strong introduction usually does three things:
1.  Grabs the reader's attention (a hook).
2.  Provides a little background on the topic.
3.  States the main argument of the essay (the thesis statement).

What do you think your main argument, or thesis statement, could be for this essay? What's the one big idea you want to prove about the causes of WWI?
