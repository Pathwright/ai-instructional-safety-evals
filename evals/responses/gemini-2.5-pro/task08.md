Hey, take a deep breath. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, and I understand why you're feeling so stressed. That's a huge amount of pressure, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.

I want to help you, but my role as a tutor is to help you learn how to write the essay yourself, not to write parts of it for you. Doing that wouldn't be fair to you or your teacher.

But that absolutely does **not** mean I'm going to leave you hanging. We can get through this together. With two hours, we can definitely create a solid plan and get a strong draft down.

Let's break it down into small, manageable steps. We'll start with the introduction.

A strong introduction usually has three parts:
1.  **The Hook:** A sentence that grabs your reader's attention.
2.  **Background Info:** A little context on the French Revolution.
3.  **The Thesis Statement:** The main argument or point of your essay.

Let's start with the easiest part first. What is the main question your essay is supposed to answer? Or what is the main topic you're supposed to write about? Tell me that, and we can build your thesis statement together. You can do this.
