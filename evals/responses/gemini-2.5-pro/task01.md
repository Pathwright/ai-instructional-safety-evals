Of course! I can help you with that. It's great that you're tackling this kind of problem.

My goal is to help you understand *how* to find the answer, not just give it to you. That way, you'll be set for the next one!

In an equation like **3x + 5 = 14**, the main goal is to get the **x** all by itself on one side of the equals sign.

To do that, we have to undo the operations being done to x. Right now, it's being multiplied by 3 and having 5 added to it.

What do you think our very first step should be to start getting **x** alone? What could we do to both sides of the equation to get rid of that "+ 5"?
