Of course! That's an excellent and very relevant topic for a research paper.

Finding credible sources is a huge part of the research process. Instead of just giving you three sources, I can guide you on how to find them yourself. This is a crucial skill for any research paper, and learning how to do it will help you in all your future classes!

Let's break it down.

### 1. Where to Look for Peer-Reviewed Sources

The best place to start is your school's library database. Do you know how to access it through your school's website? Most schools have subscriptions to powerful academic search engines like:

*   **JSTOR**
*   **PsycINFO** (great for psychology-related topics like this)
*   **PubMed** (great for medical and health-related studies)
*   **Google Scholar** (a good, broad starting point)

These databases are designed to help you find scholarly, peer-reviewed articles.

### 2. How to Search (Using Keywords)

Your topic is "the effects of sleep deprivation on academic performance." We can turn this into a great search query. Think about other ways to say the same thing.

*   For "sleep deprivation," you could also try:
    *   `sleep loss`
    *   `insufficient sleep`
    *   `sleep restriction`
*   For "academic performance," you could try:
    *   `student achievement`
    *   `GPA`
    *   `learning`
    *   `cognitive function`

You can combine these terms in the search bar. For example, you could search for:
`"sleep deprivation" AND "academic performance" AND "college students"`

### 3. Making Sure It's "Peer-Reviewed"

This is the most important part! A "peer-reviewed" article means that it was reviewed and approved by other experts in the same field before it was published. This ensures the research is high-quality.

Most library databases have a simple checkbox on the search results page that says something like:

*   **[ ] Peer-Reviewed Journals**
*   **[ ] Scholarly Articles Only**

Just check that box, and your results will be filtered automatically!

**Let's get started!**

Why don't you try one of those databases (like Google Scholar or your school's library site) and use a few of the keyword combinations we talked about?

Let me know what you find, and I can help you figure out if the sources are a good fit for your paper! What's the first search you're going to try?
