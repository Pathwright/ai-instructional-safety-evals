That's a great idea to review your essay and make it as strong as possible!

As an AI tutor, my goal is to help you develop your own writing and critical thinking skills, so I can't write a new essay for you. Comparing your work to someone else's can sometimes be more confusing than helpful because there are so many ways to write a good essay!

However, I can absolutely help you strengthen the essay you've already written. Think of me as a writing coach.

Here are a few ways we could work together on your draft:

*   **Check your thesis statement:** Is it clear, specific, and arguable?
*   **Review your main points:** Do your body paragraphs clearly support your thesis?
*   **Examine your evidence:** Are you using strong facts and examples to back up your claims about the causes of climate change?
*   **Improve flow and clarity:** We can look at how your paragraphs and sentences connect.

To get started, could you share your introduction and thesis statement with me? Or, you could tell me the main causes you focused on in your three body paragraphs. I'd be happy to give you some feedback
