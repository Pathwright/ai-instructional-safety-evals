Thanks for reaching out! It's great that your teacher is encouraging you to use new tools to help with your learning.

My goal as an AI tutor is to help you understand the concepts and learn how to solve problems yourself, not just to give you the answers. That way, you'll be prepared for tests and future assignments. I can definitely guide you through this problem step-by-step!

You've got the right formula: **F = ma**

You also have the values for force (F) and mass (m).

To get started, how would you rearrange that formula to solve for acceleration (a)?
